# HuffmanCoding

Huffman coding. Implement Huffman coding as explained in class and described in the Subject notes.
This assumes that you will also provide an implementation of a BinaryHeap (aka array with the required
Heap properties) with operations as described in class. Non-compliance to this will automatically gain you
a zero. (See Handout 2.) Your implementation must work with arbitrary files binary or not. We will test it
minimally on a text file, PDF, and JPG or MPEG. Avoid getting distracted with the Wikipedia code: it is
not PrP compliant, and its use will cause a violation of the NJIT Honors code (see the last page of Handout
1/Syllabus under Collaboration).

Argument filename in the command-line below is an arbitrary file-name. It can be p1610s18.pdf, or
p1610s18.tex, or image1.jpg, or say 01aug25 flare.mpg, or something else. The suffix (sometimes
called the extension) is what follows the dot (eg pdf, tex, jpg, mpg). Although we do not ask for your implementation
to be optimal and fast we require that it is relatively efficient. Thus Huffman coding (encoding
or decoding) of a 2MiB file should not take more than 15-30 seconds in Java, C, or C++ on an AFS machine
with reasonable load. Moreover your implementation should result in some compression savings for
reasonable test files (though do not expect any in small text files or jpg files).

As stated under RULE 1, resolve issues with command-line processing or file-based input/output early
in the semester. Never prompt for input as testing would be automated to some degree. So command line
processing to the specifications is a MUST. My suggestion is to always read files in binary. If you donâ€™t
know what i mean, pick a pdf file build a histogram of its bytes add up its frequencies and make sure that
sum is equal to the size of the file as reported by an ls -l in a UNIX/Linux/OSX system. Write code to
copy the file into another file and compare them using md5sum (a Unix/Linux/etc command).

// Encode : henc encodes filename into filename.huf and filename gets erased
// thus x.pdf generates x.pdf.huf and then x.pdf gets erased
// Decode : hdec decodes filename.huf into filename and filename.huf gets erased
// if filename already exists, it gets overwritten
// thus x.pdf.huf generates x.pdf and then x.pdf.huf gets erased
// Note : Per Handout 2 you should use hencWXYZ or hdec_WXYZ for henc and hdec

% java henc filename.pdf
% java hdec filename.pdf.huf
% ./henc filename.pdf
% ./hdec filename.pdf.huf
// EXAMPLE testing steps
% cp p1610s18.pdf file1 // copy into file1
% java henc file1 // Huffman encode file1 into file1.huf
% rm -rf file1 // If not already removed, we remove it to continue testing
% java hdec file1.huf // Huffman decode file1.huf
% diff p1610s18.pdf file1 // If different something went wrong! diff might not work
% md5sum p1610s18.pdf file1 // Should have same signatures; this is better
// EXAMPLE C or C++
% cp p1610s18.pdf file1
% ./henc file1
% rm -rf file1
% ./hdec file1.huf
% diff p1610s18.pdf file1
% md5sum p1610s18.pdf file1
